# BattleHits - World of Tanks Mod

## 🚀 Overview

**BattleHits** is an easy-to-use modification for the game **World of Tanks**. This mod enhances your post-battle experience by showing all the shots dealt by or to your vehicle right from the lobby. Track your in-game performance more efficiently and analyze how you’ve been hit or how you’ve hits during your battles!

## 🌟 Features

- 🔍 **View Battle Shots**: Easily access all shots made by your tank or those made against you in the lobby.
- 🛠️ **Hangar Replacement**: Select the option to swap the default hangar in the settings to use the BattleHits hangar.
- 🔄 **Replay Support**: Display previously played battles by playing a WOTReplay file; the mod will store all data and display it in the lobby.
